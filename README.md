# Faustus
Faustus is collection of small python scripts and classes that do various things.

The scripts are more a sandbox for me to (re)learn Python programming.

## Scripts list
- `MobileCrop.py` is a script to crop mobile screenshots.
  Use `./MobileCrope.py -h` for help.
- `DirBackup.py` is a script to do a complete rsync of defined folder.
  Use `./DirBackup.py -h` for help.
- `PlsMaker.py` (WIP) is a script to create playlist fast in a number of ways.
  Use `./PlsMaker.py -h` for help.
- `DeDuplicate.py` is a script to catch duplicate in a media collection.
  Typically, this was made after screwing up my songs list, as correcting ID3
  tags created lots of duplicate songs / directories.
- `CbzArchive.py` is a class to download some specific comic books and
  compress them as a comic book archive.
- `SrvBackup.py` (WIP) is a class for maintaining consistent backup of a server.
  It contains a simple `mysqldump` at this moment, but should include in the
  future a full website directory backup, config backup, and probably a image
  backup for RPi SDCards.
- `RgbDmcConverter.py` (WIP) is a class aimed at converting images (mostly pixel
  art) to [DMC](http://www.dmc.fr) colors for cross stitching.

## Side Note
Faustus is a minor NPC from the video games [Legacy of Kain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Kain).
