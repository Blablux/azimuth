# Faustus
Faustus is collection of small python scripts and classes that do various
things.

The scripts are more a sandbox for me to (re)learn Python programming.

## Scripts list
- `mobile-crop.py` is a script to crop mobile screenshots.
  Use `./mobile-crope.py -h` for help.
- `dir-backup.py` is a script to do a complete rsync of defined folder.
  Use `./dir-backup.py -h` for help.
- `pls-maker.py` (WIP) is a script to create playlist fast in a number of ways.
  Use `./pls-maker.py -h` for help.
- `cbz-archive.py` is a class to download some specific comic books and
compress them as a comic book archive.
- `rgb-dmc-converter.py` is a class aimed at converting images (mostly pixel
art) to [DMC](http://www.dmc.fr) colors for cross stitching.

## Side Note
Faustus is minor NPC from the video games
[Legacy of Kain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_of_Kain).
