# Faustus
Faustus is collection of small python scripts that do various things.

The scripts are more a sandbox for me to (re)learn Python programming.

## Scripts list
- `mobile-crop.py` is a script to crop mobile screenshots.
  Use `./mobile-crope.py -h` for help.
- `dir-backup.py` is a script to do a complete rsync of defined folder.
  Use `./dir-backup.py -h` for help.
- `pls-maker.py` (WIP) is a script to create playlist fast in a number of ways.
  Use `./pls-maker.py -h` for help.
- `cbz-archive.py` is a script to create comic book archives.
  Use `./cbz-archive.py -h` for help.

## Side Note
Faustus is minor NPC from the video games
